# Compound Finance: an exploration in money markets

## The DeFi movement

Ethereum boasts itself as programmable store-of-value. The crypto bubble of 2017 saw an explosion of assets (tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain - each one claiming to have unlocked a use-case. Unfortunately, quite a few scammers also benefitted from that. It wasn't clear whether there are any use-cases at all? A movement was formed in late 2018 to explore digital finance. The idea was to give some structure to the ever-growing world of token economics and disrupt the traditional banking system. The movement has since then gone through a series of iterations and is looking more mature now. This post is going to be an exploration of **Compound Finance** - a crucial protocol and sits at the heart of money markets.

## What is Compound Finance?

Compound Finance describes itself as a decentralized protocol which establishes _money markets_ with algorithmically set _interest rates_ based on supply and demand, allowing users to frictionlessly exchange the time value of Ethereum assets.

Before getting into Compound Finance, let's visit the world of traditional finance. And understand how everything works together there.

The money market is the trade in short-term debt investments. It is characterized by a high degree of safety and a relatively low return in interest. On the widest scale, the money market is one of the pillars of the global financial system and involves overnight swaps of vast amounts of money between banks and the U.S. government. In all cases, they are low-risk investments that have maturities ranging from overnight to just under one year. That short life makes them almost as liquid as cash. That is, the principal is safe and the money is not inaccessible for long.

- creation of money markets on the Ethereum blockchain
- individuals and institutions are able to earn interest on digital assets that they supply to the protocol
- the financial concept, ‘the time value of money’, which stipulates that money in the present is worth more than the identical sum of money that is received in the future
- problem found with holding digital assets, which is financial yield
- lenders that are seeking to earn a return on non-yielding digital assets, and borrowers that are seeking to use borrowed assets for productive or investment use
- **money markets** are where financial instruments with high liquidity and short maturities are traded
- will lend to the protocol itself. The compound protocol then aggregates the supply of lent funds, resulting in a high level of liquidity for that money market
- withdraw their tokens at any time
- Price Oracle, which keeps track of the current exchange rate of each supported digital asset on the protocol.
- The responsibility of setting the value of assets on the protocol is delegated to a committee, which pools the prices of supported assets from the top 10 exchanges in the cryptocurrency space. These exchange rates are used by the protocol to determine the borrowing capacity and collateral requirements for an account, and any other function that requires calculating the value equivalent of an account on the protocol.
- interest rate mechanism
- Liquidation
- governance model for Compound is to start off as being under centralized control. However, it is intended that, over time, control of the protocol will transition to the community
