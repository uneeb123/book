# Explaining MakerDAO: stablecoin

## Risk profiles

Volatility refers to the amount of uncertainty or risk related to the size of changes in a security's value. It can either be measured by using the standard deviation or variance between returns from the security. Different market participants have different risk profiles. Highly volatile assets present an opportunity for some, but for others it can be an exasperation. Some investors tend to seek steady earnings through either capital appreciation or yield. Others trade volatile assets to make money. In the world of blockchain, there is a dire need for low volatile assets, as they open up a new class of investing opportunities. This has led to a quest for stablecoins. Price is a function of supply and demand. And so, volatility is simply a result of the underlying **supply and demand** characteristics of the market.
