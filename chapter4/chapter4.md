- creation of money markets on the Ethereum blockchain
- individuals and institutions are able to earn interest on digital assets that they supply to the protocol
- the financial concept, ‘the time value of money’, which stipulates that money in the present is worth more than the identical sum of money that is received in the future
- problem found with holding digital assets, which is financial yield
- lenders that are seeking to earn a return on non-yielding digital assets, and borrowers that are seeking to use borrowed assets for productive or investment use
- **money markets** are where financial instruments with high liquidity and short maturities are traded
- will lend to the protocol itself. The compound protocol then aggregates the supply of lent funds, resulting in a high level of liquidity for that money market
- withdraw their tokens at any time
- Price Oracle, which keeps track of the current exchange rate of each supported digital asset on the protocol.
- The responsibility of setting the value of assets on the protocol is delegated to a committee, which pools the prices of supported assets from the top 10 exchanges in the cryptocurrency space. These exchange rates are used by the protocol to determine the borrowing capacity and collateral requirements for an account, and any other function that requires calculating the value equivalent of an account on the protocol.
- interest rate mechanism
- Liquidation
- governance model for Compound is to start off as being under centralized control. However, it is intended that, over time, control of the protocol will transition to the community
