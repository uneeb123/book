# Economies through time

Ever since Bitcoin was invented, people have been fixated on money. They have been discussing at great lengths how money is defined. Whether Bitcoin can or should be considered money. People have drawn analogies from history. Analyzed how value is captured philosophically. And derived different models that money should comply with. Nick Szabo is the thought leader of this space and he has been pinning his thoughts about evolution of money for a really long time now [1]. I believe that while it is true that money has evolved over time and taken many shapes and forms, I think it is more important to understand the historical movements that have sparked those changes. That is what I want to achieve through this post. A journey through time of how economics evolved.

Speed and volatility

Supply and demand

Gold

Gaeber

Merchants revolution

One of the biggest problem that Bitcoin has today is that

USA - great depression
IOU
Silver - spanish conquest
