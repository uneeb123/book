# Primer on the crypto-ecosystem

# Getting upto speed on crypto space

When I was still early in my crypto explorations, I was very skeptical of most "blockchain" projects. To me, only Bitcoin made sense. It had the stress tested technology behind it; the mainstream adoption; a great story; and plenty of room to grow. As I went deeper into the crypto rabbit hole, I realized that I wasn’t the only one who shared that sentiment. Lots of folks in the past believed that too, only to change their mind later. I had a lot to learn. I was game - so I rolled up my sleeves and dived right into the meat of the matter. After reading a few dozen specs and debating with crypto advocates online, it became clear to me that there were a lot less imposters than I had previously thought and the Bitcoin limitations were quite real. When Turing Award winners get into the race of creating a better Bitcoin (algorand link here), you can assume that at least they've found an interesting angle. In fact, contrary to popular opinion, I'd even go as far as arguing that the notion of blockchain makes complete sense. It's a class of decentralized database protocols that communicate via consensus. The more I explored various projects, the more it began to dawn on me how naive I had been to consider this space full of scams. At this point, I was feeling insecure and doubtful of whether I should pursue further? Heck, in for a penny, in for a pound!

By now, I was fairly convinced that I have mapped out the ecosystem quite well. There are always newcomers to the scene, but I know the big players. As time passed, I saw projects falter. And I realized that some ideas, although brilliant in nature, aren't really able to establish themselves. They have brilliant minds behind them. Backing from the best VCs. Enough influence power to move markets. And yet they fail. And then you see you see a team of four 20-something from midwest Milwaukee building a product that gains strong momentum. It’s a mad world I tell you. But however it is, here we stand. United by one common objective: to build the crypto-economy for the world. The superset of cryptocurrencies. I might not do justice in pin-pointing the motivations of why we are here. But you can sense that everyone in this space shares a common passion. They see the problems in the world that they want to take control of them. It's not an easy one by any means. And we only make slow, small incremental progress. I want to spend the next section of this post highlighting what that is.

But let’s be clear on the vision first. Why is crypto-economy even necessary? What benefit do you get from an open financial system? I personally think that the reason is so simple and is staring us right in the face that even if I spell it out, you might not see it. It took me a while to get it and I spent years sleeping on it. Crypto is money. And we think money doesn’t work as it should. That’s not to say that the current system is per se broken. It is simply outdated. I mean the world is connected in ways like never before. If I take a step out of my apartment in San Francisco and walk just three blocks, I am guaranteed to see people of different races; religions; nationalities speaking in different languages and dialects. Nations of the past were built on ideologies. That is obviously not true any more. But what does that have to do with Bitcoin? Bitcoin is just decentralized currency that you can hodl and wait for the pumps so you can buy the lambos. But then there was Satoshi Nakamoto. The originator of cryptocurrency whose identity till this date is unknown. Whose worth is nearly \$19 billion dollars, but what is he doing? He should come out and claim his fame and money. This signals to me that this movement is more than just money. Also, are we going to simply ignore the fact that Bitcoin started right after the financial crash of 2008? For the sake of brevity, I won’t go too deep into the weeds of financial markets. But money isn’t just the thing you use to buy apples and oranges. It is what powers your society. Most of your wealth isn’t in cash. It’s in your bank accounts or your assets that are constantly compounding away. An open financial system simply means to open up the financial system such that everyone becomes an equal participant. Just as Bitcoin is open so anyone - no matter where he is geographically located - can invest in Bitcoin.

Now that the vision is out of the way, let’s talk about some of the short-comings of the space. The way I see it.

Trust is a core tenet of finance. Gold is widely respected as a commodity because it has built that level of trust over decades. If financial markets are shaken up, people retort back to gold as a safe haven. After recent fears of recession, many expected that Bitcoin might be able to take that sport. Especially, since it is digital and easy to obtain. However, Bitcoin is extremely volatile. Ray Dalio has alluded to that fact quite often. Bitcoin simply doesn’t have the trust that is necessarily for a financial instrument to be safe haven of funds. And it would take years for it to get there. Murad Mahmudov, a cryptocurrency trader who has made quite a name for himself, has been quite vocal about it. His thesis is that over time Bitcoin would stabilize in value and achieve the store of value status. I agree with his theory, but if crypto has taught me one thing, its that this space moves lightning fast. And instead of expecting Bitcoin to achieve that level of trust, what if we build on top of the infrastructure something new. Trust is attained by guarantees and control. In fact, one can argue that tokens that are pegged to stable value are examples of such level of control. I will get into stable-coins later, but I specifically want to target trust for now. I believe we can introduce regulatory measures in cryptocurrency that will make it more trustworthy. For instance, ICOs get an incredibly bad rep in the media. And for good reasons, lots of people were fooled into thinking that they were investing in assets that were going to blow up. Flashy marketing everywhere. And then, after several pumps and dumps, it was quite clear what was going on. Cryptocurrency’s reputation was tarnish and a great use-case of being able to raise money on the blockchain went to waste. A few weeks ago, someone mocked on Twitter that initial exchange offerings were gaining momentum again and it should be stopped. I was appalled. One of the major benefit of capitalism is that businesses can raise money. And how will they be able to do that if we keep shunning ICOs and token offerings. I do think IEOs would make better ICOs. Simply because there is someone liable if things go haywire. It’s not a perfect solution, but it’s the set in the right direction. A few days ago, Opyn came up with a proposal to offer decentralized insurance on the blockchain. Now that’s a great experiment. Will be quite interesting to see what comes out of that. All-in-all, I believe that regulations has to get better on blockchain. And I am expecting to see more offerings that specifically target on building trust.

Another big problem with crypto space is a cultural one. It is the issue of inclusion. Despite claims that the technology is centralized and that anyone can build on top of that, the fact of the matter is that there are only a handful of miners that dominate most of the crypto validation. And companies that building on top of the blockchain are not making financial inclusion their top priority. You might commonly hear that crypto wants to bank the unbind, but the truth is that, for instance, folks in Venezuela aren’t quite ready to use Bitcoin as their means of transaction. And experiments to enable them might be detrimental for them. Some of these remote regions don’t even have electricity available to them. As someone who is from Pakistan, I believe I understand the ground reality better than most folks. However, empowering businesses is a characteristic of a healthy functioning financial market and so the focus should be on enablement rather than enforcement. And for that reason, the token economy should become a way for people to raise money. Even charity should be made a possibility. There are plenty of homeless people in US who are well-suited to work in the society but are struggling to put them on the ground. Maybe we can start with that instead?

I also feel that the focus is too much on average consumer. So doesn’t possess too much understanding of finance. Sure, we all invest in stocks, but the majority of the investments are done by insitutions that spends years calculating risks models. Crypto needs to bootstrap financial markets that can focus on those users. Some efforts are already underway - for instance, DeFi has gained quite a bit of momentum last year. And Compound that purports itself as a savings account does offer quite good savings rates. And exactly where I think where our engineering efforts should go. We need more financial instruments, so our risks equations can accommodate for different models that asset managers can be lured into. Combine that with macro-investments in global projects and we have ourselves a new form of society. Imagine being able to invest in an asset that in turn buys bonds for clean energy. That’s the world we should be living in. Not the one where we are politically being deceived into funding wars in Yemen. To iterate, I want to see debt/credit with various risk profiles, stable currencies, tokenized assets on the blockchain.

Another very interesting movements that started with cryptocurrency, but has now diverged into its own class is of decentralized ledgers. The idea here being that instead of having central servers where our data is stored, let’s leverage the blockchain technology to create records that owned via private/public key and live in a unified, shared ledger. There are lots of interesting proposals for this and it’s a problem close to the heart of many engineers. You’d be surprised to learn that while the technology is nearly ready for consumption, the market for it doesn’t quite exist. For instance, no-one quite cares about decentralized YouTube when the real YouTube has all the content you want to consume. I believe that as novel business use-cases arise, this space will evolve. For instance, what if we want integrate Facebook-like identity into national passports? Even how nearly everyone has a Facebook account that is arguably the best form of verification of someone’s identity, that use-case might be as far off as one think. However, in order to support such a use-case, we’d need stronger controls over privacy.

Lets talk about the biggest stretch of a point. But what it all culminates to: a new form of governance? Imagine for a second that we are able to bootstrap financial markets. Investment firms on cryptocurrency are more efficient than traditional investments firm - making more money and enabling more businesses to prosper - ushering a new era of growth. Financial inclusion is so strong that no matter where you are in the world, you can participate in the global economy. We discover talent from remote locations. And more niche categories are developed than ever before. The world really does get a boost of acceleration. Pace of innovation increases beyond the wildest imagination and today’s growth seems an ancient history in comparison. Global currency, global ledger. Decentralized databases take over and data can exchanged maintaining full privacy of the user. Visa documents; passports; licenses; certificates are all digitized and verifiable over the network. Now the question is: will this breed a new form of governance? Maybe an overarching form of control that ensures interest of the global citizens equipped with financial power. That might sound sci-fi. But I truly believe that we might not be far off.
