# Primer on the crypto-ecosystem

When I was still early in my crypto explorations, I was very skeptical of most "blockchain" projects. To me, only Bitcoin made sense. The technology had stood the test of time; a buzzing market; a great story; and plenty of innovative ways to grow. As I went deeper into the crypto rabbit hole, I realized that I wasn’t the only one who shared that sentiment. Lots of folks in the past believed that too, only to change their mind later. I felt far behind in the race. I was game - so I rolled up my sleeves and dived right into the meat of the matter. After reading a few dozen specs and reading critiques of crypto analysts, it became clear to me that there were a lot less imposters than I had previously anticipated and the Bitcoin limitations were quite real. When Turing Award winners get into the race of creating a [better Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/turing-award-winners-blockchain-opens-test-network-to-public), you can safely assume that there is some unsolved problem here. The terminology, that initially I didn't like, started to resonate with me. I'd even go as far as to say that the notion of blockchain makes complete sense. It's a class of decentralized database protocols that communicate via consensus. It's not a database. It really demonstrates the limitations of the CAP theorem. The more I explored various projects, the more it began to dawn on me how naive I had been to consider this space full of scams. At this point, I was feeling insecure and doubtful of whether to pursue further? But as the unwise saying goes: in for a penny, in for a pound!

By now, I was fairly convinced that I have mapped out the ecosystem quite well. There are always newcomers to the scene, but I know the big players. As time passed, I saw projects falter. And I realized that some ideas, although brilliant in nature, aren't really able to establish themselves. They have smart minds behind them. Backing from the top notch VCs. Enough power of influence to move markets. And yet they fail. And then you see you see a team of four twenty-something from midwest Milwaukee building a product that gains strong momentum. It’s a mad world. But, however it is, it can be circumscribed by one common objective: to build the crypto-economy for the world. The superset of cryptocurrencies. I might not do justice in pin-pointing the motivations. But you can sense that everyone in this space seem to have embarked on a collective mission. They see problems with how money and power works. And they think it's possible to do better. Some think it's best to rebuild finance ground up. Others believe that crypto can be used to used to empower developing economies. Some fare that government and Wall Street has amassed too much power in their hands. And it is time to present financial alternatives. This puts cryptocurrency in a very promising position. But over-promising and under-delivering leads to a bitter taste. And lately, that has been the case. So I want spend a few minutes to highlight how crypto-economy is uniquely positioned and what I expect to see going forward. Bear in mind, this is decade-long process and we only make small incremental progress.

Why is crypto-economy even necessary? Or more broadly, why do we need an open financial system? The reason is staring us in the face. Yet it took me a while to get it. And I spent years sleeping on it. Crypto is money and if I say that money is broken, you'd probably assume that maybe people aren't correctly incentivatized. Maybe the disparity between rich and poor has grown to a large degree. Not untrue, but not exactly news either. The real issue is that our system is simply outdated and ill-equipped to take on modern challenges. Take globalization for instance. The nations of the past were built on ideologies. That simply isn't true anymore. As a person belonging to a religious minority, I don't need the state to protect me. Seeking asylum was the solution of previous era. Today we, citizens of the world, know how to react. The world is connected in ways like never before. If you live in a metropolitan city, like I do, you probably meet a bunch of people belonging to different races; religions; nationalities speaking in different languages and dialects. Our wealth is distributed in various parts of the world. Chinese investors buy land in US. You, a trader, can invest in Japanese stocks - and effectively Japanese companies. Most people I know have lived in at least two different continents and if not, they have visited a few different places. Our devices are mobile. Our homes transient. And while, we have gone global, our social institutions haven't. We cap international students coming into American universities. But it doesn't make sense. We debate climate change, but hold no institutional body responsible. We declare wars on terrorism - not by consensus, but by authority. Internet companies build nation-blind products, but face challenges on national fronts. Citizens of different countries are not treated equally. And Bitcoin? Bitcoin isn't just decentralized currency. Bitcoin was a digital, nation-less, unstoppable currency - built by an unknown person(s). Bitcoin is a movement. Not just an attempt to make money - that many incorrectly assume. Bitcoin gives birth to an open financial system.

Due to lack of understanding of finance, most folks focus too much the average consumer. When will I buy coffee with Bitcoin? Sure, we all invest in stocks, but the majority of the investments are done by insitutions that spends years perfecting their risk models. Crypto needs to bootstrap financial markets that can focus on those users. Some efforts are already underway - for instance, DeFi has gained quite a bit of momentum last year. And Compound that purports itself as a savings account offer good savings rates. And exactly where I think where our engineering efforts should go. We need more financial instruments, so our risks equations can accommodate for different models that asset managers can be lured into. Combine that with macro-investments in global projects and we have ourselves a new form of society. Imagine being able to invest in an asset that in turn buys bonds for clean energy. That’s the world we should be living in. Not the one where we are politically being deceived into funding wars in Yemen. To iterate, I want to see debt/credit with various risk profiles, stable currencies, tokenized assets on the blockchain.

Trust is a core tenet of finance. If you have spent time building technology products, this might be a hardest pill to swallow. Trust has to be obtained. Neither a great marketer can help you there, nor can a brilliant sales pitch. But your father's advice might change your mind about making an investment. Gold is widely respected as a commodity because it has accurued a certain level of trust over decades. If financial markets are shaken up, people would retort back to gold as a safe haven. When Ray Dalio was asked about Bitcoin, after fears of recession, his response was that Bitcoin is very volatile and hence not a good store of value. That upsetted many crypto folks. But he is right. Murad Mahmudov, a cryptocurrency trader who has made quite a name for himself, understands this quite well and has built his investment thesis around growing level of trust in Bitcoin. He argues that Bitcoin, over time, would stabilize in value and achieve the true store of value status. Eventually becoming a unit of account and a medium of exchange. A view many contest. I have my own opinions too. If there is anything I've learnt from being in this space is that it evolves rapidly. For a casual lurker, crypto narratives might be hard to follow. But anyone in the rabbit-hole can tell you how fast the story is developing. Hence I believe that instead of sitting around and waiting for Bitcoin to achieve that level of trust, the ecosystem, as a whole, will end up building something less risk averse on top of the current infrastructure. Risk would be controlled by turning nobs and handles. This is already in very nascent stages. But over time financial engineering will allow for less-risky investments and essentially enable more liquidity to be injected into the system enabling further experimentation. One can make a case that tokens that are pegged to stable value are examples of such level of control. Such as Maker and \$DAI. Blockchain company Compound further allows you to earn interest on \$DAI. Today if you Google "DeFi", you will find a plethora of interesting projects that are building on the premise of introducing more financial engineering into the ecosystem.

But I believe financial engineering alone isn't sufficient. Regulation plays a big part in finance. Who is to be held accountable if a blockchain company holding a \$1 billion position decides to exit-scam and ends up buying mansions in Malta? We have to introduce some regulatory measures. That isn't all theoretical and wishful-thinking. Maker is a decentralized body that attempts to regulate the control of the stable coin \$DAI by allowing token-holder to vote on key issues. But it's challenging problem. Recently, nearly \$1 million were lost in arbitrage as a new player attempted to build a complex financial intrument. Who is be blamed in such a scenario? The contract developers who missed the loophole? Product owners that released the feature without thorough testing? Or people whose money were lost? A more prominent example is that of ICOs that raised a ton of money and didn't deliver on the promise. In lieu of that, intial exchange offerings were proposed that haven't quite materialized, but allow more guarantees for investors. Insurance, on the blockchain, is another fascinating movement to watch and new players such as Opyn are trying to tap into this market. All-in-all, I believe that regulations has to get better on blockchain. And it has to come internally - as opposed to external measures of a jurisdiction providing assurances that customer's assets are in safe hands.

Trading bruh...

Another very interesting movements that started with cryptocurrency, but has now diverged into its own class is of decentralized ledgers. The idea here being that instead of having central servers where our data is stored, let’s leverage the blockchain technology to create records that owned via private/public key and live in a unified, shared ledger. There are lots of interesting proposals for this and it’s a problem close to the heart of many engineers. You’d be surprised to learn that while the technology is nearly ready for consumption, the market for it doesn’t quite exist. For instance, no-one quite cares about decentralized YouTube when the real YouTube has all the content you want to consume. I believe that as novel business use-cases arise, this space will evolve. For instance, what if we want integrate Facebook-like identity into national passports? Even how nearly everyone has a Facebook account that is arguably the best form of verification of someone’s identity, that use-case might be as far off as one think. However, in order to support such a use-case, we’d need stronger controls over privacy.

Lets talk about the biggest stretch of a point. But what it all culminates to: a new form of governance? Imagine for a second that we are able to bootstrap financial markets. Investment firms on cryptocurrency are more efficient than traditional investments firm - making more money and enabling more businesses to prosper - ushering a new era of growth. Financial inclusion is so strong that no matter where you are in the world, you can participate in the global economy. We discover talent from remote locations. And more niche categories are developed than ever before. The world really does get a boost of acceleration. Pace of innovation increases beyond the wildest imagination and today’s growth seems an ancient history in comparison. Global currency, global ledger. Decentralized databases take over and data can exchanged maintaining full privacy of the user. Visa documents; passports; licenses; certificates are all digitized and verifiable over the network. Now the question is: will this breed a new form of governance? Maybe an overarching form of control that ensures interest of the global citizens equipped with financial power. That might sound sci-fi. But I truly believe that we might not be far off.
