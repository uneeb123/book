# Primer on the crypto-ecosystem

When I was still early in my crypto explorations, I was very skeptical of most "blockchain" projects. To me, only Bitcoin made sense. The technology had stood the test of time; an exploding market buzz; a great story; and plenty of innovative ways to grow. As I went deeper into the crypto rabbit hole, I realized that I wasn’t the only one who shared that sentiment. Lots of folks in the past believed that too, only to change their mind later. I felt far behind in the race. I was game - so I rolled up my sleeves and dived right into the meat of the matter. After reading a few dozen specs and reading critiques of crypto analysts, it became clear to me that there were a lot less imposters than I had previously anticipated and the Bitcoin limitations were quite real. When Turing Award winners get into the race of creating a [better Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/turing-award-winners-blockchain-opens-test-network-to-public), you can safely assume that there is some unsolved problem here. The terminology, that initially I didn't like, started to resonate with me. I'd even go as far as to say that the notion of blockchain makes complete sense. It's a class of decentralized database protocols that communicate via consensus. It's not a database. It really demonstrates the limitations of the CAP theorem. The more I explored various projects, the more it began to dawn on me how naive I had been to consider this space full of scams. At this point, I was feeling insecure and doubtful of whether I should pursue further? But as the unwise saying goes: in for a penny, in for a pound!

By now, I was fairly convinced that I have mapped out the ecosystem quite well. There are always newcomers to the scene, but I know the big players. As time passed, I saw projects falter. And I realized that some ideas, although brilliant in nature, aren't really able to establish themselves. They have smart minds behind them. Backing from the top notch VCs. Enough influence power to move markets. And yet they fail. And then you see you see a team of four twenty-something from midwest Milwaukee building a product that gains strong momentum. It’s a mad world. But, however it is, it can be circumscribed by one common objective: to build the crypto-economy for the world. The superset of cryptocurrencies. I might not do justice in pin-pointing the motivations. But you can sense that everyone in this space seem to have embarked on a collective mission. They see problems with how money and power works. And they think it's possible to do better. Some think it's best to rebuild finance from ground up. Others believe that crypto can be used to used to empower developing economies. Some fare that government and Wall Street has amassed too much power in their hands. And it is time to present financial alternatives. This puts cryptocurrency in a very promising position. But over-promising and under-delivering leads to a bitter taste. And lately, that has been the case. So I want spend a few minutes to highlight how crypto-economy is uniquely positioned and what I expect to see going forward. Bare in mind, this is decade-long process and we only make small incremental progress.

Why is crypto-economy even necessary? Or more broadly, why do we need an open financial system? I think the reason is staring us in the face. But it took me a while to get it and I spent years sleeping on it. Crypto is money and if I say that money is broken, you'd probably assume that maybe people aren't rightly incentivatized. Maybe the disparity between rich and poor has grown to a large degree. Not untrue, but not exactly news either. The real issue is that our system is simply outdated and ill-equipped to take on modern challenges. Take globalization for instance. The nations of the past were built on ideologies. That simply isn't true anymore. As a person belonging to a religious minority, I don't need the state to protect me. Seeking asylum was the solution of previous era. Today we, citizens of the world, know how to react. The world is connected in ways like never before. If you live in a metropolitan city, like I do, you probably meet a bunch of people belonging to different races; religions; nationalities speaking in different languages and dialects. Our wealth is distributed in various parts of the world. Chinese investors buy land in US. You, a trader, can invest in Japanese stocks - and effectively Japanese companies. Most people I know have lived in at least two different continents and if not, they have visited a few different places. Our devices are mobile. Our homes transient. And while, we have gone global, our social institutions haven't. We cap international students coming into Harvard at just 20%. We debate climate change, but hold no institutional body responsible. We declare wars on terrorism - not by consensus, but by authority. Internet companies build state-less products, but face different challenges in differents nations. Citizens of different countries are not treated equally. But what does that all have anything to do with Bitcoin? Isn't Bitcoin just decentralized currency that you can hold on to and hope that one day you'll be able to buy Lamborghinis? Except if you think about it, that wasn't quite what Bitcoin was set out to do. Satoshi Nakamoto, the originator of cryptocurrency whose identity till this date is unknown, created a peer-to-peer digital currency that can not be interfered by the state. This movement is more than just an attempt to make money. Bitcoin gives birth to an open financial system.

Trust is a core tenet of finance. Gold is widely respected as a commodity because it has accurued that level of trust over decades. If financial markets are shaken up, people retort back to gold as a safe haven. After recent fears of recession, many expected that Bitcoin might be able to take that spot. Especially, since it is digitally native and readily available. However, Bitcoin's property of being volatilite is an hinderance to that. As Ray Dalio has frequently alluded to when asked whether the asset should be taken seriously. Simply put, it is not a safe haven of funds. And it would a good chunk of effort to get there. Murad Mahmudov, a cryptocurrency trader who has made quite a name for himself, understands this quite well and has built his investment thesis around this principle of trust. He argues that Bitcoin, over time, would stabilize in value and achieve the true store of value status. And eventually become a unit of account as well. But if there is one thing that I've learnt from being in this space is that this space moves lightning fast. So how about instead of expecting Bitcoin to achieve that level of trust, we build something less risk averse on top of the current infrastructure? Risk can be controlled by turning nobs and handles. Essentially, engineering financial instrumentation. One can argue that tokens that are pegged to stable value are examples of such level of control. I believe we can introduce regulatory measures in cryptocurrency that will make it more trustworthy. For instance, Initial coin offering from '17 get an incredibly bad rep in the media and for good reasons. Lots of people were fooled into thinking that they were investing in assets that were going to blow up. Flashy marketing lured them into scammy deals. And then, after a few pumps and dumps, it was quite clear what was going on. Cryptocurrency’s reputation was tarnished and a great use-case of being able to raise money on the blockchain went to waste. A few weeks ago, someone mocked on Twitter that initial exchange offerings were gaining momentum again and it should be stopped. I was appalled. One of the major benefit of capitalism is that businesses can raise money. And how will they be able to do that if we keep shunning ICOs and token offerings. I do think IEOs would make better ICOs. Simply because there is someone liable if things go haywire. It’s not a perfect solution, but it’s the set in the right direction. A few days ago, Opyn came up with a proposal to offer decentralized insurance on the blockchain. Now that’s a great experiment. Will be quite interesting to see what comes out of that. All-in-all, I believe that regulations has to get better on blockchain. And I am expecting to see more offerings that specifically target on building trust.

Another big problem with crypto space is a cultural one. It is the issue of inclusion. Despite claims that the technology is centralized and that anyone can build on top of that, the fact of the matter is that there are only a handful of miners that dominate most of the crypto validation. And companies that building on top of the blockchain are not making financial inclusion their top priority. You might commonly hear that crypto wants to bank the unbanked, but the truth of the matter is folks in Venezuela aren’t quite ready to use Bitcoin as their means of transaction. And experiments to enable them might be detrimental for them. Some of these remote regions don’t even have electricity available to them. As someone who is from Pakistan, I believe I understand the ground reality better than most folks. However, empowering businesses is a characteristic of a healthy functioning financial market and so the focus should be on enablement rather than enforcement. And for that reason, the token economy should become a way for people to raise money. Even charity should be made a possibility. There are plenty of homeless people in US who are well-suited to work in the society but are struggling to put them on the ground. Maybe we can start with that instead?

I also feel that the focus is too much on average consumer. So doesn’t possess too much understanding of finance. Sure, we all invest in stocks, but the majority of the investments are done by insitutions that spends years calculating risks models. Crypto needs to bootstrap financial markets that can focus on those users. Some efforts are already underway - for instance, DeFi has gained quite a bit of momentum last year. And Compound that purports itself as a savings account does offer quite good savings rates. And exactly where I think where our engineering efforts should go. We need more financial instruments, so our risks equations can accommodate for different models that asset managers can be lured into. Combine that with macro-investments in global projects and we have ourselves a new form of society. Imagine being able to invest in an asset that in turn buys bonds for clean energy. That’s the world we should be living in. Not the one where we are politically being deceived into funding wars in Yemen. To iterate, I want to see debt/credit with various risk profiles, stable currencies, tokenized assets on the blockchain.

Another very interesting movements that started with cryptocurrency, but has now diverged into its own class is of decentralized ledgers. The idea here being that instead of having central servers where our data is stored, let’s leverage the blockchain technology to create records that owned via private/public key and live in a unified, shared ledger. There are lots of interesting proposals for this and it’s a problem close to the heart of many engineers. You’d be surprised to learn that while the technology is nearly ready for consumption, the market for it doesn’t quite exist. For instance, no-one quite cares about decentralized YouTube when the real YouTube has all the content you want to consume. I believe that as novel business use-cases arise, this space will evolve. For instance, what if we want integrate Facebook-like identity into national passports? Even how nearly everyone has a Facebook account that is arguably the best form of verification of someone’s identity, that use-case might be as far off as one think. However, in order to support such a use-case, we’d need stronger controls over privacy.

Lets talk about the biggest stretch of a point. But what it all culminates to: a new form of governance? Imagine for a second that we are able to bootstrap financial markets. Investment firms on cryptocurrency are more efficient than traditional investments firm - making more money and enabling more businesses to prosper - ushering a new era of growth. Financial inclusion is so strong that no matter where you are in the world, you can participate in the global economy. We discover talent from remote locations. And more niche categories are developed than ever before. The world really does get a boost of acceleration. Pace of innovation increases beyond the wildest imagination and today’s growth seems an ancient history in comparison. Global currency, global ledger. Decentralized databases take over and data can exchanged maintaining full privacy of the user. Visa documents; passports; licenses; certificates are all digitized and verifiable over the network. Now the question is: will this breed a new form of governance? Maybe an overarching form of control that ensures interest of the global citizens equipped with financial power. That might sound sci-fi. But I truly believe that we might not be far off.
