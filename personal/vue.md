# Why I will choose Vue over React in future

First of all, let me preface this by saying that you absolutely shouldn't learn a new framework because it is going to help you build a better interface. I've been back and forth on this myself a few times. My argument in favor was that while React itself doesn't give you design superpowers out of the box, there is a large pool of community tools that you can easily tap into. There is MaterialUI for React and ElementUI for Vue. But I've gone full 180 degrees on my stance. Most probably, you don't need them.

Not expert but been using Redux yadda yadda

Faster rendering tweet bullcrap

Tooling: ElementUI vs MaterialUI
