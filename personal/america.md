# The year is 2023

We are just about the end of the term of Liz Warren. The white house has swung super left; the billionaires are still arguing that it'll destroy the economic power of America; people are getting annoyed the rising taxes that they have to pay now; at the time, a lot of folks are pleasantly surprised that public services are actually improving. Parks have gotten much better. There is greenery to be seen on the roads. The city looks clean. Most likely because blue collar workers are happier. But one person's happiness is another person's misery. Renowned bank that was riddled with corruption is now officially closing. Unfortunately, this means that many innocent people will lose their job too. Technology companies are in a dilemma. Lot of startup ran out of funding and as a result had to be shut down. While this pleased many, as that meant that only those survived that were truly on the right path, but less room for experimentation is bothering economist and venture capitalist. They are looking for other havens that provides more lax arrangement. At the beginning, some flee the country and went on to live in various parts of the world. But realizing that the infrastructure isn't quite available in other places, they had no option but to come back. At times the talent pool just didn't really exist. At other times, more relaxation simply meant bypassing the rules and exploiting people. This frustrated quite a few. And that led to some counter movements. In particular, the Internet became even more vibrant than ever before. Capitalism had moved to the online world.

Andrew Yang is still preaching benefits of the capitalist society while there are protests right in his backyard. Some people can't believe how this person was elected. Fox News, in particular, is running a documentary on how the system was exploited by a group of hackers. A wave of neoliberals is on the rise. Dystopia. Black outs. Hacking.
